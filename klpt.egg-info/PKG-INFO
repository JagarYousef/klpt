        ### Welcome/*HÃ»n bi xÃªr hatin*/Ø¨Û• Ø®ÛŽØ± Ø¨ÛŽÙ†! ðŸ™‚
        
        
        Kurdish Language Processing Toolkit--KLPT is a [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP) toolkit for the [Kurdish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_languages). The current version (0.1) comes with four core modules, namely `preprocess`, `stem`, `transliterate` and `tokenize` and addresses basic language processing tasks such as text preprocessing, stemming, tokenziation, spell-checking and morphological analysis for the [Sorani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorani) and the [Kurmanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurmanji) dialects of Kurdish.

You can do so by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/sinaahmadi) to accompany me in this journey and help the Kurdish language have a better place within other natural languages on the web. Depending on your support,
        
        - You can be officially my sponsor
        - You will get a GitHub sponsor badge on your profile
        - If you have any questionsn I will focus on it
