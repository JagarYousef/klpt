# How to help Kurdish language processing?

One of our main objectives in this project is to promote collaborative projects with **open-source** outcomes. If you are generous and passionate to volunteer and help the Kurdish language, there are three ways you can do so:

1. If you are a native Kurdish speaker with general knowledge about Kurdish and are comfortable working with computer, [contributing to collaboratively-curated resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia) is the best starting point, particularly to:
	- [Wîkîferheng - the Kurdish Wiktionary](https://ku.wiktionary.org/wiki/Destp%C3%AAk)
	- Wikipedia in [Sorani](https://ckb.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%DB%95%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%BE%DB%8E%DA%A9) and in [Kurmanji](https://ku.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destp%C3%AAk)
	- [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/eng/) in Sorani and Kurmanji
2. If you have expertise in Kurdish linguistics, you can take part in annotation tasks. Having a basic understanding on computational linguistics is a plus but not a must. Please get in touch by joining the [KurdishNLP community on Gitter](https://gitter.im/KurdishNLP). **Our collaborations oftentimes lead to a scientific paper** depending on the task. Please check the following repositories to find out about some of our previous projects:
	- [Kurdish tokenization](https://github.com/sinaahmadi/KurdishTokenization)
	- [Kurdish Hunspell](https://github.com/sinaahmadi/KurdishHunspell)
	- [Kurdish transliteration](https://github.com/sinaahmadi/wergor)

3. If you are not included in 1 and 2 but have basic knowledge about Kurdish, particularly writing in Kurdish, you are invited to create content online. You can start creating a blog or tweet in Kurdish. After all, **every single person is a contributor as well**.

In any case, please follow this project and introduce it to your friends. Test the tool and raise your issues so that we can fix them.
