## How to help

One of our main objectives in this project is to promote collaborative projects with **open-source** outcomes. If you are generous enough to volunteer, like us, and help the Kurdish language, there are three ways you can do to:

1- If you have expertise in Kurdish linguistics, you can take part in annotation tasks. Having a basic understanding on computational linguistics is a plus but not a must.
2- If you are iffy about your knowledge in Kurdish but have expertise in computer programming, you can also contribute to this project.
3- If you are not included in 1 and 2 but have basic knowledge about Kurdish, particularly writing in Kurdish, you can contribute to lexicon development. The current lexicons include less than 20,000 headwords which should be further extended.

In any case, please follow this project and introduce it to your surrounding. Test the tool and raise your issues so that we can fix them.




## What is next?



I am aware that many Kurds are interested in their language and many times, they invest their passion into literature. Well, that's amazing, but we are living in the IT era. We do need poets and novelists, but programmer and NLP engineers too. Therefore, I am planning to initiate an NLP course in Kurdish in the coming months.
