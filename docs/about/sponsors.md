## Become a sponsor 

Please consider donating to the project. Data annotation and resource creation requires tremendous amount of time and linguistic expertise. Even a trivial donation will make a difference. You can do so by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/sinaahmadi) to accompany me in this journey and help the Kurdish language have a better place within other natural languages on the Web. Depending on your support,

- You can be an official sponsor
- You will get a GitHub sponsor badge on your profile
- If you have any questions, I will focus on it
- If you want, I will add your name or company logo on the front page of your preferred project
- Your contribution will be acknowledged in one of my future papers in a field of your choice
